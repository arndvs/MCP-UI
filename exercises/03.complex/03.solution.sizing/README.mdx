# Sizing

👨‍💼 Great work! We've successfully solved a key problem for our users: now the journal viewer displays at the optimal size for comfortable reading. This makes the interface much more user-friendly and professional, which is exactly what our users expect.

This improvement means users get a properly sized viewing experience without having to manually resize the frame. The journal entries now appear in a well-proportioned window that makes reading and interacting with content much more pleasant.
