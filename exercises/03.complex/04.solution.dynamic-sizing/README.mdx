👨‍💼 Perfect! Our journal viewer now measures its content and tells the host exactly how much space it needs. Short entries no longer waste space, and long entries display completely without scrolling.

The iframe now feels like a native part of the application (while preserving our app's branding) by automatically adapting to show each journal entry at its optimal size.

🧝‍♀️ I'm going to abstract some of this stuff in a custom hook to make it easier to use. Feel free to do that yourself or just <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink>.
