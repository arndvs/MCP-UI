👨‍💼 Great work! We've successfully solved a key problem for our users: now they can view their journal entries in a rich, interactive interface instead of just plain text. This makes the journal viewing experience much more engaging and professional.

This improvement means users get a full-featured journal viewer with proper styling, responsive design, and interactive elements. The iframe approach gives us access to the entire web ecosystem while maintaining secure communication with the host application.
