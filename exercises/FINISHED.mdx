Hooray! You made it through the whole workshop! üëè

## What you've learned

### 1. Simple - Raw HTML UI Resources

Learned the core pattern: use `createUIResource` to return a `rawHtml` UI resource instead of plain text. You delivered styled, visual output (e.g. info cards) and saw how a `uri` + content type package UI for compliant clients.

### 2. Consistent - Remote DOM

Moved from hand-authored HTML/CSS to a component-driven, host-consistent layer (Shopify's Remote DOM). You gained: design system consistency, built-in interactivity, less styling drift, and safer structured creation of elements (`ui-text`, `ui-button`, etc.).

### 3. Complex - Iframe / Embedded Apps

Escalated to full application surfaces using the `externalUrl` content type. Added preferred sizing metadata, understood lifecycle messages, and decomposed complexity into an independently deployed (or locally served) app. Sub-steps introduced readiness, fixed sizing, and dynamic resizing strategies.

### 4. Interactive - Communication Protocol

Empowered iframes to participate in workflows: sending `link`, `tool`, and `prompt` messages via `postMessage`. You handled message IDs, async responses, and error feedback‚Äîturning passive UI into an active collaborator with the host + MCP toolchain.

### 5. Advanced - Tool Results & Render Data

Closed the loop on data richness and performance:

- **Structured Tool Results:** Defined output schemas so clients can safely parse, validate, and branch on outcomes (e.g. metrics, suggestions).
- **Render Data:** Preloaded initial iframe data through `uiMetadata` (`initial-render-data`) to avoid extra network hops and securely pass contextual, possibly private data at creation time.

### Putting It All Together

Across the progression you learned how to choose the right abstraction:

- Raw HTML ‚Üí quickest path to visual output
- Remote DOM ‚Üí consistency & built-in components
- Iframe Apps ‚Üí full framework power & complex interaction
- Protocol Messaging ‚Üí rich, bi-directional intent + action
- Structured Results & Render Data ‚Üí reliability, safety, and performance

### Next Steps

You're well equipped to ship production-grade MCP UI experiences. Consider:

- Converting existing plain-text MCP tools into visual UI resources
- Adding schema validation everywhere a boundary exists (tool inputs/outputs, render data)
- Building a reusable internal component library for Remote DOM use
- Layering authorization & audit logging around iframe messages
- Contributing examples or docs back to the MCP UI ecosystem

You've taken AI interaction from linear text to adaptive, interactive surfaces that feel native and intentional. Nicely done. Keep experimenting‚Äîand ship something real next.
