# Send Prompts

üë®‚Äçüíº Big win here. Users can now hit "Summarize" and immediately get a concise, insightful take on the entry they're viewing. This closes the loop between curiosity and clarity: they ask, the system interprets, and the answer shows up without disrupting their flow.

Under the hood, we wired the iframe to send a `prompt` message through our MCP bridge and handle the response cleanly:

- **New capability**: `sendMcpMessage('prompt', { prompt }, { signal })` so components can request AI assistance directly.
- **UX benefit**: No reloads, no context loss. The UI stays responsive while the request is in flight.
- **Reliability**: Requests are abortable via `useUnmountSignal()`, so we don't leak work when users navigate away.

This turns "Summarize" from a promise into a dependable action. Users now trust that our UI can ask the right question and deliver the right kind of answer at the right moment.
