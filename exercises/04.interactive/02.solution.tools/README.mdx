# Call Tools

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicai.pro/workshops/day-5-6-mcp-ui/tools-ow1ol/solution" />

👨‍💼 We can now call MCP tools directly from within the UI components. This makes the interface truly interactive and functional, which is exactly what our users need for a complete experience.

This improvement means users get immediate access to powerful functionality without leaving the interface. Instead of just viewing data, they can now take actions like deleting tags, creating entries, and performing other operations seamlessly. This transforms the UI from a static display into a dynamic, interactive workspace.

🧝‍♀️ I'm going to add this to the delete button in the entry-viewer as well. Feel free to <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink>.
