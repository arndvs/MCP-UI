# Interactive

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented interactive communication in your iframe-based UI components. You've transformed static iframes into dynamic components that can communicate with the host application to trigger actions, execute tools, and send prompts.

Your iframes now actively communicate with the host using the MCP UI communication protocol, enabling rich interactions while maintaining security boundaries.

You learned how to send `link`, `tool`, and `prompt` messages from your iframe to the host, with proper error handling.

Now on to the next!
