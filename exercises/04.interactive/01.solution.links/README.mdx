# Navigate to Links

👨‍💼 Super! Now users can click buttons in our iframe-based UI components and navigate to external links seamlessly. Users can now share their journal entries on social media!

🧝‍♀️ I'm going to be doing more of what we just did and adding some utilities to make it easier. We're going to turn this into a general utility you'll be able to use for other actions like `tool` and `prompt`. If you want extra work, you can try to do that yourself or just <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink>.
