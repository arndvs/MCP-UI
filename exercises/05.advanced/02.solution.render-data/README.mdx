# Render Data

👨‍💼 Great work! We've successfully implemented render data for our journal entry viewer, solving a critical security problem. Now we can securely pass protected data from our MCP server to the iframe component.

Well done!

	🦉 You can also proactively request render data at any time (even after
	initialization) with `ui-request-render-data` and providing a unique
	`messageId`. Learn more from
