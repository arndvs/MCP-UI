# Raw HTML

👨‍💼 Great work! We've successfully transformed our tag information from plain text responses into rich, visual interfaces that users can quickly scan and understand. This is a game-changer for user experience - instead of users having to parse through walls of text to find tag information, they now get immediate, scannable visual cards that make the information feel accessible and professional.

This improvement means users get instant visual feedback when they ask about tags, making the AI assistant feel more like a modern application and less like a command-line tool. The visual presentation helps users quickly identify tag names and descriptions without having to read through paragraphs of text.

🧝‍♀️ I'm going to be doing more of what we just did and make it prettier. Feel free to do that yourself or just <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink> if you're interested.
