# Simple

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented your first MCP UI feature. You've transformed a basic text-based MCP tool into a rich, visual interface that provides users with an immediately scannable and professional experience.

You learned how to use the `createUIResource` function from `@mcp-ui/server` to package HTML content into a format that MCP clients can understand and render. Instead of returning plain text like "javascript: A programming language for web development", your tool now returns a beautifully formatted HTML card that displays the tag name prominently and includes a clear description.

This transformation makes your AI assistant feel more like a modern application and less like a command-line tool. Users can now quickly scan tag information visually instead of parsing through walls of text, making the experience more engaging and professional.

Let's keep moving to continue making the user experience even better with more advanced UI capabilities!
