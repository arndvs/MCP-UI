👨‍💼 Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get oriented and to give you your assignments for the workshop!

Welcome to **MCP UI 🪟**! In this workshop, you'll dive into the world of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)—an open protocol designed to seamlessly connect AI models with external data sources and tools. [MCP UI](https://mcpui.dev) is a powerful extension to the spec that enables servers to send rich, interactive user interfaces along with their responses, transforming AI chat into visually engaging experiences.

Throughout this workshop, you'll learn:

- The core concepts of MCP UI and how it extends the MCP protocol
- How to create raw HTML UI resources
- How to create consistent UI with Remote DOM
- How to build complex interactions with iframe-based UI components
- How to implement interactive communication between iframes and the host using `postMessage`
- Advanced features like structured tool results and passing initial render data
