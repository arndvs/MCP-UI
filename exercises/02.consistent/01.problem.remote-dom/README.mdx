# Remote DOM

<callout-warning>
	As of the time of this writing, no popular AI Agent apps support MCP-UI with
	Remote DOM, so you'll need to use your imagination üåà

üë®‚Äçüíº When users interact with our journaling app, they expect a consistent, professional experience that feels native to the application they're using. Right now, our tag viewer uses raw HTML which means our UI is rendered in an iframe and cannot resemble the variety of agents using our MCP server because it can't integrate with the host application's design system. Users notice this inconsistency and it makes our app feel less polished and trustworthy.

The problem is that raw HTML gives us complete control but also complete responsibility for every aspect of the user interface. This leads to a fragmented user experience where each UI component feels like it belongs to a different application.

Instead, we can use Remote DOM to create UI components that automatically inherit the host application's design system. This means our tag viewer will look and feel like it belongs in whatever application the user is using, whether that's a chat interface, a dashboard, or a mobile app.

```ts
// New approach: Remote DOM with consistent components
const resource = createUIResource({
	uri: 'ui://weather-card/singapore',
	content: {
		type: 'remoteDom',
		framework: 'react',
		script: `
			const stack = document.createElement('ui-stack');
			stack.setAttribute('direction', 'vertical');
			stack.setAttribute('spacing', '20');
			stack.setAttribute('align', 'center');

			const title = document.createElement('ui-text');
			title.setAttribute('content', 'Singapore');
			stack.appendChild(title);

			const temperature = document.createElement('ui-text');
			temperature.setAttribute('content', '88¬∞F - Partly Cloudy');
			stack.appendChild(temperature);

			const details = document.createElement('ui-text');
			details.setAttribute('content', 'Humidity: 78% | Wind: 12 mph');
			stack.appendChild(details);

			root.appendChild(stack);
		`,
	},
	encoding: 'text',
})
```

<callout-info>
	Remote DOM uses JavaScript to create and manipulate DOM elements using
	predefined UI components like `ui-stack`, `ui-text`, and `ui-button`. These
	components are automatically styled and provide consistent behavior across the
	host application.
