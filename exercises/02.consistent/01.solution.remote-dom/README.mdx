# Remote DOM

👨‍💼 Excellent work! We've successfully transformed our tag viewer from raw HTML to Remote DOM, solving a critical user experience problem. Now our UI components automatically inherit the host application's design system, creating a consistent and professional experience that feels native to whatever application our users are using.

This transformation means users get a cohesive experience where our tag viewer looks and feels like it belongs in their chat interface, dashboard, or mobile app. Instead of a jarring iframe with custom styling that stands out, they now see beautifully integrated components that match their application's visual language.

The key improvement is that we've moved from writing static HTML with custom CSS to using JavaScript that creates DOM elements with predefined UI components. This provides automatic styling, built-in interactivity, and seamless integration with the host application's design system.

🧝‍♀️ We're going to change direction and take it up a notch by creating a web server that renders a custom-built React UI with React Router. This is a pretty big addition to our setup, so feel free to <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink> if you're interested.
