# Consistent

Congratulations! You've successfully transformed your MCP UI from raw HTML to Remote DOM, solving a critical user experience problem. You've moved from writing static HTML with custom CSS to using JavaScript that creates DOM elements with predefined UI components.

	The key improvement is that your UI components now automatically inherit the
	host application's design system, creating a consistent and professional
	experience that feels native to whatever application your users are using.

Instead of rendering in an iframe with custom styling that stands out, your tag viewer now uses `ui-stack`, `ui-text`, and `ui-button` components that seamlessly integrate with the host application's visual language. This means users get a cohesive experience whether they're using your MCP server in a chat interface, dashboard, or mobile app.

Let's keep moving to continue making the user experience even better with more advanced UI capabilities!
